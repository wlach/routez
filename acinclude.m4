# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PYTHON
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro does a complete Python development environment check.
#
#   It recurses through several python versions (from 2.1 to 2.5 in this
#   version), looking for an executable. When it finds an executable, it
#   looks to find the header files and library.
#
#   It sets PYTHON_BIN to the name of the python executable,
#   PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR to the directory holding the header files, and
#   PYTHON_LIB to the name of the Python library.
#
#   This macro calls AC_SUBST on PYTHON_BIN (via AC_CHECK_PROG),
#   PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and PYTHON_LIB.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_BOOST_PYTHON
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro checks to see if the Boost.Python library is installed. It
#   also attempts to guess the currect library name using several attempts.
#   It tries to build the library name using a user supplied name or suffix
#   and then just the raw library.
#
#   If the library is found, HAVE_BOOST_PYTHON is defined and
#   BOOST_PYTHON_LIB is set to the name of the library.
#
#   This macro calls AC_SUBST(BOOST_PYTHON_LIB).
#
#   In order to ensure that the Python headers are specified on the include
#   path, this macro requires AX_PYTHON to be called.
