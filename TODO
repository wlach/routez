== Near term ==

- Pick low-hanging fruit to optimize libroutez.
- Improve web interface.
- Clean paths between gtfs stops

== Medium term ==

- Just use Django instead of Railways? Problem is that a graph needs
   to be loaded on startup-- need/want a way to do that cleanly.
- Add better heuristics to make libroutez consider less options
- Clean up libroutez, make into a proper library.
- De-entangle application from Halifax (not much work required).

== Blue sky ==

- Make maps visualization use OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps.
