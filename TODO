== Near term ==

- Pick low-hanging fruit to optimize libroutez.
- Improve web interface.
- Make libroutez return multiple possible routes
- Use a kd-tree to speed up finding closest stop to a latlng pair.
- Return route and stop information as needed, instead of loading it all
every time a page is accessed.

== Medium term ==

- Add better heuristics to make libroutez consider less options
- Clean up libroutez, make into a proper library.
- De-entangle application from Halifax (not much work required).

== Blue sky ==

- Make maps visualization use OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps.
