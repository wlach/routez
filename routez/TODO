== Near term ==

- De-entangle application from Halifax/hbus.ca. Should split into routez
  (the application that provides route information, trip planning, etc.)
  and a website/javascript layer on top of that...

== Medium term ==

- Make libroutez return multiple possible routes
- Use a kd-tree to speed up finding closest stop to a latlng pair.
- Add better heuristics to make libroutez consider less options
