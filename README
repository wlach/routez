=== About ===

Routez is a trip planning web service written in Python and Javascript as 
well as a pathfinding library written in C++. The latter part will probably
eventually be abstracted out and released seperately.

=== Initial Setup ===

1. Download and install the following packages:
 - Google Transit Data Feed (http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/)
   - As of this writing you need what's in SVN, as it has a fix that I made
   to actually handle interpolated stops correctly. The next version after
   1.1.9 should have my fix.
 - Python ParseDateTime (http://code-bear.com/code/parsedatetime/)
   - I used version 0.8.6.
 - Railways (http://github.com/sebastien/railways/)
   - Use the latest git
 - boost::python
 - Python YAML
   - Just getting these from Debian or Ubuntu is probably easiest.

To install a python package in a local prefix, do:
 
  "python setup.py install --home=$HOME"

You may need to set PYTHONPATH to $HOME/lib/python first.

2. Download the Halifax Transit Feed Distribution:

http://github.com/wlach/halifax-transit-feed

Instructions on building the feed are contained within the README. It's mostly
just a matter of typing 'make', once everything's set up.

3. Download OpenStreetMap data for Halifax.

I put up a semi-recent set at:

   http://wlach.masalalabs.ca/most-of-halifax-plus-brentwood.osm

3. Build the C++ graph module.

The usual...

 - ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

4. Build a graph corresponding to the OSM and GTFS data

Something like:

 - ./creategraph.py /path/to/hfxfeed.zip /path/to/osmfile.osm mygraph.routez

5. Build a database of stop and route information from the GTFS feed

 - ./manage.py syncdb
 - ./createdb.py /path/to/hfxfeed.zip

6. Run it!

 - ./routez.py --graph=mygraph.routez
