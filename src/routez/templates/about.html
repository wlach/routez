    <h2>Motivation and Philosophy</h2>
    <p>The aim of hbus.ca is to make bus and ferry travel in Halifax and the surrounding regions easier and more enjoyable, by reducing the time needed to 
      plan trips. Want to go somewhere? Our philosophy is that you should be able to get an answer to that question in as little time as possible.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>hbus.ca was built on top of many technologies, some proprietary, some open source.</p>
    <p>The main software that drives this site is called "Routez". It
    is built on top of the <a href="http://djangoproject.org">Django
    framework</a>, with lots of JavaScript code in the
    front end. The giant map you see is courtesy of the
    <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps">CloudMade
    Maps API</a> as well as the tireless work of amazing
    <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetmap</a>
    volunteers. The actual pathfinding is done via the opensource <a
    href="http://github.com/wlach/libroutez">libroutez</a> library.</p>
    
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>hbus.ca uses the official Google Transit feed generated by Metro Transit, with some minor modifications to make stop locations easier to 
      understand. Unfortunately our agreement with them prevents us from sharing this data directly with users-- if you're interested in 
      using this information for a project, please contact them directly. Also, our use of their data notwithstanding, Metro Transit has no 
      involvement with this site.</p>
