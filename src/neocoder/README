=== About ===

neocoder is intended to be an extremely fast and versatile geocoding library, 
offered under an extremely liberal license. It is not yet considered ready for
general use.

=== Building ===

You can build and install neocoder via the standard:

'./configure && make && make install'. 

You'll need libpcre (http://www.pcre.org/). On Linux, you should be able to
grab a package with the development headers via your distributions package
manager (e.g. on Ubuntu Karmic the package is 'libpcre3-dev'). On MacOS X,
just do a './configure && make && make install' after downloading and
unpacking the libpcre distribution.
