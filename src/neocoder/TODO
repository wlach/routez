Todo list (accurate as of 7 February 2010) in rough order of priority:

- Unit tests for geocoder (requires some kind of sample data set...)
- More precise intersection parser (use more than just roads)
- Return of multiple results where there is ambiguity
- Incorporate Canadian provinces into regular expressions
- OpenStreetMap data parser
- French/Quebec address parsing
- U.S. address parsing
